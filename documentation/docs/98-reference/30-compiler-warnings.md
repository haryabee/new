title: 'Compiler warnings'

Svelte warns you at compile time if it catches potential mistakes, such as writing inaccessible markup.

Some warnings may be incorrect in your concrete use case. You can disable such false positives by placing a `<!-- svelte-ignore <code> -->` comment above the line that causes the warning. Example:

```svelte
<!-- svelte-ignore a11y_autofocus -->
<input autofocus />
```

You can list multiple rules in a single comment, and add an explanatory note alongside them:

```svelte
<!-- svelte-ignore a11y_click_events_have_key_events, a11y_no_static_element_interactions (because of reasons) -->
<div on:click>...</div>
```

> [!NOTE] Svelte 5 components are no longer classes. Instantiate them using 'mount' or 'hydrate' (imported from 'svelte') instead.

## `node_invalid_placement_ssr`

> [!NOTE] %thing% is invalid inside '\<%parent%>'. When rendering this component on the server, the resulting HTML will be modified by the browser, likely resulting in a 'hydration_mismatch' warning

HTML restricts where certain elements can appear. In case of a violation the browser will 'repair' the HTML in a way that breaks Svelte's assumptions about the structure of your components. Some examples:

- `<p>hello <div>world</div></p>` will result in `<p>hello </p><div>world</div><p></p>` for example (the `<div>` autoclosed the `<p>` because `<p>` cannot contain block-level elements)
- `<option><div>option a</div></option>` will result in `<option>option a</option>` (the `<div>` is removed)
- `<table><tr><td>cell</td></tr></table>` will result in `<table><tbody><tr><td>cell</td></tr></tbody></table>` (a `<tbody>` is auto-inserted)

This code will work when the component is rendered on the client (which is why this is a warning rather than an error), but if you use server rendering it will cause hydration to fail.

## `non_reactive_update`

> [!NOTE] '%name%' is updated, but is not declared with '$state(...)'. Changing its value will not correctly trigger updates

## `options_deprecated_accessors`

> [!NOTE] The 'accessors' option has been deprecated. It will have no effect in runes mode

## `options_deprecated_immutable`

> [!NOTE] The 'immutable' option has been deprecated. It will have no effect in runes mode

## `options_missing_custom_element`

> [!NOTE] The 'customElement' option is used when generating a custom element. Did you forget the 'customElement: true' compile option?

## `options_removed_enable_sourcemap`

> [!NOTE] The 'enableSourcemap' option has been removed. Source maps are always generated now, and tooling can choose to ignore them

## `options_removed_hydratable`

> [!NOTE] The 'hydratable' option has been removed. Svelte components are always hydratable now

## `options_removed_loop_guard_timeout`

> [!NOTE] The 'loopGuardTimeout' option has been removed

## `options_renamed_ssr_dom`

> [!NOTE] 'generate: "dom"' and 'generate: "ssr"' options have been renamed to "client" and "server" respectively

## `perf_avoid_inline_class`

> [!NOTE] Avoid 'new class' — instead, declare the class at the top level scope

## `perf_avoid_nested_class`

> [!NOTE] Avoid declaring classes below the top level scope

## `reactive_declaration_invalid_placement`

> [!NOTE] Reactive declarations only exist at the top level of the instance script

## `reactive_declaration_module_script_dependency`

> [!NOTE] Reassignments of module-level declarations will not cause reactive statements to update

## `reactive_declaration_non_reactive_property`

> [!NOTE] Properties of objects and arrays are not reactive unless in runes mode. Changes to this property will not cause the reactive statement to update

## `script_context_deprecated`

> [!NOTE] 'context="module"' is deprecated, use the 'module' attribute instead

## `script_unknown_attribute`

> [!NOTE] Unrecognized attribute — should be one of 'generics', 'lang' or 'module'. If this exists for a preprocessor, ensure that the preprocessor removes it

## `slot_element_deprecated`

> [!NOTE] Using '\<slot>' to render parent content is deprecated. Use '{@render ...}' tags instead

## `state_referenced_locally`

> [!NOTE] State referenced in its own scope will never update. Did you mean to reference it inside a closure?

## `store_rune_conflict`

> [!NOTE] It looks like you're using the '$%name%' rune, but there is a local binding called '%name%'. Referencing a local variable with a '$' prefix will create a store subscription. Please rename '%name%' to avoid the ambiguity

## `svelte_component_deprecated`

> [!NOTE] '\<svelte:component>' is deprecated in runes mode — components are dynamic by default

In previous versions of Svelte, the component constructor was fixed when the component was rendered. In other words, if you wanted `<X>` to re-render when `X` changed, you would either have to use `<svelte:component this={X}>` or put the component inside a `{#key X}...{/key}` block.

In Svelte 5 this is no longer true — if `X` changes, `<X>` re-renders.

In some cases `<object.property>` syntax can be used as a replacement; a lowercased variable with property access is recognized as a component in Svelte 5.

For complex component resolution logic, an intermediary, capitalized variable may be necessary. E.g. in places where `@const` can be used:

```diff
{#each items as item}
-	<svelte:component this={item.condition ? Y : Z} />
+	{@const Component = item.condition ? Y : Z}
+	<Component />
{/each}
```

A derived value may be used in other contexts:

```diff
<script>
	...
	let condition = $state(false);
+	const Component = $derived(condition ? Y : Z);
</script>
- <svelte:component this={condition ? Y : Z} />
+ <Component />
```

## `svelte_element_invalid_this`

> [!NOTE] 'this' should be an '{expression}'. Using a string attribute value will cause an error in future versions of Svelte

## `svelte_self_deprecated`

> [!NOTE] '\<svelte:self>' is deprecated — use self-imports (e.g. 'import %name% from './%basename%'') instead

## `unknown_code`

> [!NOTE] '%code%' is not a recognised code

> [!NOTE] '%code%' is not a recognised code (did you mean '%suggestion%'?)
